# Controls

Input comes from SDL3 gamepads, the keyboard and the mouse, merged into one Switch controller (`runtime/input.c`,
`runtime/input_win.c`). Every connected gamepad is kept open and the game reads the one pressed last; a gamepad
switched on in play is found within a second. Buttons are ORed; each stick takes the source with the larger
deflection. Keys and mouse buttons count only while the game window is in the foreground. `NX2NAVI_INPUT=none`
disables both (automated runs). `NX2NAVI_*` settings can also be set in `nx2navi.ini` next to the exe (`input = none`,
`motion = 0`, `rumble = 0`); the environment overrides the file. `NX2NAVI_RUMBLE_STRENGTH` is the rumble strength in
percent (0 to 300, default 130; 0 is the same as `rumble = 0`). `NX2NAVI_RUMBLE_CURVE` is the exponent applied to the
amplitude before the strength (0.2 to 1.5, default 0.6; lower makes weak pulses stronger, 1 is linear).
`NX2NAVI_RUMBLE_TRIGGERS=1` also drives the impulse triggers of an Xbox pad. `NX2NAVI_DS3=1` turns on the direct reader for a DualShock 3 (see PlayStation 3 controllers).

`NX2NAVI_PAD_LAYOUT` (`pad_layout`, the *Button layout* row on the Controls tab, live) picks which face button is Switch A:

- `nintendo` (default): by position, as on a Switch (the table below).
- `xbox`: south A, east B, west X, north Y, as an Xbox pad labels them; on a PlayStation pad cross is A, circle B, square X, triangle Y.
- `playstation`: the same buttons as `xbox` under the PlayStation name: cross A, circle B, square X, triangle Y.
- `auto`: `nintendo` for a pad whose east button SDL reports labelled A (Switch Pro Controller, Nintendo-layout pads), `xbox` for the others.

The log names the layout in effect (`input: gamepad layout ...`) and each gamepad's first press
(`input: gamepad "...": first press`); the menu shows the layout under *Automatic*. The game's prompts show the Switch
letters unless *Button prompts* says otherwise (below).

## Button prompts

`NX2NAVI_PROMPTS` (`prompts`, the *Button prompts* row on the Controls tab) picks the buttons the game's prompts show: `nintendo` (default, the game's own), `xbox`, `playstation`, `steamdeck` or `pc` (*Keyboard and mouse*). It changes three things the game draws:

- the button font every prompt in text uses (dialogue, the button guides, the controls screen): A B X Y, L R ZL ZR, Plus and Minus, the d-pad and the sticks with their directions become that pad's buttons (LB RB LT RT, Menu and View; L1 R1 L2 R2, Options and Create; its d-pad and sticks), or the keys. Power, Home and the console stay;
- the letter in the action prompt (top right);
- the ocarina's note buttons.

A, B, X and Y show the button the *Button layout* presses: with `nintendo` (by position) Switch A is the right face button, so its prompts show B or circle, B shows A or cross, X shows Y or triangle and Y shows X or square; with `xbox`, `playstation` and `automatic` (by label) A shows A or cross, B shows B or circle, X shows X or square and Y shows Y or triangle.

`pc` shows the first key each Switch button has (the table above, or the `bind_` lines of `nx2navi.ini` when the tool runs): E, Ctrl, Space, the mouse with its left button for Y, Q, R, the mouse with its right button for ZL, F, Tab, M, V and C for the stick clicks, 1 to 4 for the d-pad, and W A S D for moving, the directions the prompt means set out as on the keyboard. The camera's prompts show the mouse moving. It follows no *Button layout*.

The game reads the font and the interface textures once at start, so a change shows after a restart (the row says so; the menu's Restart button restarts). A button or key remapped on this tab keeps its old prompt until the folders are made again.

The prompts live in overlay folders next to the exe, `romfs-patches-xbox`, `romfs-patches-xbox-label`, `romfs-patches-playstation`, `romfs-patches-playstation-label`, `romfs-patches-steamdeck` and `romfs-patches-steamdeck-label` (by position and by label) and `romfs-patches-pc`, which `runtime/romfs.c` loads in place of the game's files. `tools/pad_prompts.py` draws them on the player's machine from the player's own RomFS and a folder of button art, which the repository does not hold. A launcher release or build kit made with `--prompt-art` carries that art (`prompt-art`, `tools/prompt_art.py`), and `tools/make_game.py` draws every folder in its last step, again whenever the art, the tools or the `bind_` lines change (so a rebuild after rebinding keys brings the keyboard prompts up to date). By hand:

```
python tools\pad_prompts.py --art <art pack>\Source --game <install folder>
```

`--style xbox|playstation|steamdeck|pc` makes one style; `steamdeck` shows the Deck's own labels (A B X Y where an Xbox pad has them, L1 R1 L2 R2 and L3 R3, Menu and View) and is drawn from the Xbox and PlayStation pictures, as the art has no Deck style; the keys come from `<install folder>\nx2navi.ini` (`--binds` names another). The art folder holds `XGamepad/Default`, `XGamepad/Light`, `P5Gamepad/Default`, `P5Gamepad/Light`, `Keyboard_Mouse/Dark` and `Keyboard_Mouse/White` with the file names of `STYLES` and `KEY_ART` in the tool; a key it has no picture of is written on `Keyboard_Mouse/Blanks`. Without the folders the row says *prompt files missing* and the Switch prompts stay; so they do when a RomFS mod replaces one of the same files (*off: a RomFS mod replaces their files*). The log has a `RomFS overlay: ... button prompts` line for the folder in use. The tool needs fontTools, Pillow and zstandard (`tools/requirements-py314.txt`).

The actions are the game's own, as its *Basic Controls* screen (Plus menu, System) names them:

| Switch | Gamepad (by position, Nintendo layout) | Keyboard and mouse | Action in the world |
|---|---|---|---|
| Left stick | left stick | W A S D | move |
| Right stick | right stick | mouse; arrow keys as a second source | camera |
| A | east | E, Left Shift | actions (talk, open, pick up, climb, grab); held, dash |
| B | south | Left Ctrl, Backspace | put away, cancel, back |
| X | north | Space | jump |
| Y | west | left mouse button | attack with the sword |
| ZL | left trigger (over 50%) | right mouse button, Z | target (hold or toggle, the game's *Targeting Type* option) |
| ZR | right trigger (over 50%) | F, X | use the selected item (slingshot, bow, boomerang, hookshot, bombs, bottles) |
| L | left shoulder | Q | quick-select items; previous page in the game's menus |
| R | right shoulder | R | quick-select items; next page in the game's menus |
| Left stick click | left stick click | V | (not on the game's controls screen); held, the first-person look when the `FIRST_PERSON` restoration is on ([restorations](restorations.md)) |
| Right stick click | right stick click | C, middle mouse button | reset the camera behind Link |
| D-pad left | D-pad left | 1, O | play the ocarina |
| D-pad up | D-pad up | 2 | put the accessory on or take it off |
| D-pad right | D-pad right | 3, N | talk to Navi |
| D-pad down | D-pad down | 4 | change boots |
| Plus | Start | Tab | menu: items, equipment, collection, system |
| Minus | Back | M | map |

The game's *Swap Jump Controls* option trades B and X (jump on B, put away on X); the bindings stay on the Switch buttons, so Space then puts away and Left Ctrl jumps. Left Shift is A, so holding it dashes; E presses A once for talking and opening. Esc is unbound in the game; it opens the settings menu and releases the mouse cursor (see Mouse camera). Z and X duplicate ZL and ZR on neighbouring keys. The mouse wheel is unbound. The bindings are the tables of `input_map` in `runtime/input_map.c`: the keys (platform-neutral key ids) and one gamepad table per layout (gamepad inputs by position); `runtime/input_win.c` translates Win32 virtual keys and SDL buttons.

## Window keys

| Key | Gamepad | Action |
|---|---|---|
| F1 or Esc | Minus and Plus together | open or close the settings menu; the game gets no input while it is open |
| F10 | L3 + R3 (both stick clicks) | performance overlay: off, frame rate, full panel |
| F11 | | borderless fullscreen on or off, saved to `nx2navi.ini` |

The window opens on the monitor `NX2NAVI_MONITOR` (`monitor` in `nx2navi.ini`) names, and F11 fullscreen covers the monitor the window is on. `nx2navi.exe --list-monitors` prints each monitor's index, name (on Windows its device name too), desktop rectangle, primary flag and DPI without game files; `nx2navi.exe --monitor <value>` sets `NX2NAVI_MONITOR` for one run and wins over the file. The value is `auto` (default), `primary`, an index from the list (counting from 1), or part of a monitor name (on Windows also a device name such as `display3`; on Linux the name carries the connector, such as `dp-2`); when nothing matches, the log lists the monitors and the window is placed as with `auto`. On Wayland a window cannot place itself: only fullscreen (`fullscreen = 1`) opens on the chosen monitor, and a windowed window opens where the compositor puts it.

The Minus+Plus combo never reaches the game. In the menu the arrow keys, the D-pad or the left stick move, Enter or A selects, Q and E or L and R switch tabs, Esc or B goes back (Switch button names, as in the table above). With the mouse, a click on a row selects it and a setting changes on the two framed arrows beside its value (held, an arrow repeats); a click anywhere else on the row changes nothing.

## Audio output

The sound plays on the system default device, and follows it when the Windows default changes. `NX2NAVI_AUDIO_DEVICE` (`audio_device` in `nx2navi.ini`, section `[audio]`) names another one: a number counting from 1 in the order `nx2navi.exe --list-audio-devices` prints, or part of the device's name, ignoring case. `--list-audio-devices` prints each playback device's index, name, channels and frequency without game files, marks the system default, and shows which device the setting picks; `nx2navi.exe --audio-device <value>` sets `NX2NAVI_AUDIO_DEVICE` for one run and wins over the file. When nothing matches or the device will not open, the log lists the playback devices and the game plays on the system default; a chosen device that disappears while the game runs (a virtual sink removed, a headset unplugged) also moves the sound to the system default. `audio_channels = auto` asks the chosen device how many channels it has.

## Remapping

The *Controls* tab of the settings menu lists, under the button layout, every Switch button and the eight stick directions the keys drive (movement and camera), each with two key cells and a controller cell. Each row's description says what the button does in the game. Select a cell, press A or Enter, then press the new key, mouse button or controller button; Esc or five seconds without a press cancel, and a controller button cancels a key cell. Delete, Backspace or X clears the selected cell. A key another action has moves to the new one (the description names the action it left); a controller button swaps with the one it replaces. A remapped controller button is physical: from then on the face buttons (A B X Y) stay where they are in both layouts, until the buttons are put back as the layout in use has them or *Reset all buttons* is chosen. F1, F8, F10, F11 and Esc cannot be bound (the menu, the flight recorder and the window keep them). Punctuation keys are named by their place on a US keyboard; the menu shows the character the keyboard layout in use puts there.

The tab writes `nx2navi.ini` lines, one per Switch button or stick direction: `bind_<button> = <entry>, <entry>, ...`. The button is `A B X Y L R ZL ZR PLUS MINUS LEFT UP RIGHT DOWN LCLICK RCLICK`, or a stick direction `LSTICK_LEFT LSTICK_UP LSTICK_RIGHT LSTICK_DOWN` (movement, W A S D by default) and `RSTICK_...` (camera, the arrow keys). An entry is `pad:<name>` or `key:<name>`:

- pad names: `south east west north l r zl zr start back lstick rstick dpad_left dpad_up dpad_right dpad_down lpaddle1 rpaddle1 lpaddle2 rpaddle2` (`zl`, `zr` are the triggers; the paddles are the back buttons of an Xbox Elite, DualSense Edge or Steam Controller, upper pair 1, lower pair 2, and no Switch button has them by default)
- key names: `a` to `z`, `0` to `9`, `f2` to `f7`, `f9`, `f12`, `num0` to `num9`, `space tab enter backspace lshift rshift lctrl rctrl lalt capslock insert delete home end pageup pagedown up down left right`, `num_add num_sub num_mul num_div num_decimal`, `minus equals lbracket rbracket semicolon apostrophe comma period slash backslash grave`, `mouse_l mouse_r mouse_m mouse_x1 mouse_x2`
- `key:default` and `pad:default` keep that part's defaults (`pad:default` is each layout's own button).
- `none` leaves the button unbound.

A line replaces every default of that button, pad and keyboard, so list the keys you still want or use `key:default`. Pad names are physical positions, so a line means the same in both layouts and replaces the layout's own button for that Switch button. Stick directions take keys only: the controller's sticks and the mouse camera always work. Buttons without a line keep the table above. Names are case-insensitive. An invalid entry logs one `input: bind ...` line and is skipped; a line without a valid entry changes nothing. The `NX2NAVI_BIND_<button>` environment variables work like any other setting. A changed line applies at once (`runtime/input.c` builds the tables again at its next poll).

A pad that reports its face buttons swapped (A/B and X/Y, as some GuliKit models do) is fixed with:

```
bind_A = pad:south, key:default
bind_B = pad:east, key:default
bind_X = pad:west, key:space
bind_Y = pad:north, key:mouse_l
```

## Mouse camera

Mouse motion (raw input) becomes right-stick deflection. Each presented frame takes the counts moved since the last frame, divides by the frame time and sets the deflection to `counts per second * NX2NAVI_MOUSE_SENS / 3000` of full, held for that frame, so the turn rate does not depend on the frame rate. This is not mouselook: the game's stick curve and dead zone still apply, so very slow movements do nothing and a fast flick saturates. With a camera speed other than 1 (`NX2NAVI_STICK_SENS`) the deflection is divided by that factor before it is limited to full tilt: the turn for a given movement stays the same, and the fastest turn a flick reaches is the game's top speed with the factor in it. The mouse deflection competes with the gamepad and arrow keys by the larger-deflection rule.

`NX2NAVI_MOUSE_SENS` (0 to 10, default 1; higher turns faster, 0 turns the mouse camera and the cursor capture off). While the window is the foreground window the cursor is hidden and confined to the client area. It is released on focus loss, minimise, while F11 changes the window, during a size or move loop and while a text entry is open. Esc releases it by hand: the cursor shows, the mouse camera and mouse buttons stop, and the window can be moved, minimised or closed. A mouse click inside the client area captures it again; that click does not reach the game. Activating the window by a click on its title bar or border does not capture, so it can be dragged or closed right away; Alt+Tab or a click in the client area captures as before. `NX2NAVI_INPUT=none` disables the capture too.

`NX2NAVI_STICK_DEADZONE` (0 to 50, default 8) is the gamepad stick dead zone in percent of full deflection, the same for both sticks. It is round: a stick inside the circle reads centred, and the rest of its travel is scaled to start at 0 at the edge, so full deflection still reaches full. Raise it for a stick that drifts. The game's own dead zone applies after it. `NX2NAVI_LSTICK_DEADZONE` and `NX2NAVI_RSTICK_DEADZONE` (the *Left/Right stick dead zone* rows under *Analog sticks* on the Controls tab) set one stick each and fall back to `NX2NAVI_STICK_DEADZONE` while unset, so a worn stick can get a larger zone than the other. With a gamepad connected each row shows its stick's deflection now, before the dead zone (*stick now*): let go of the stick and set the row a few percent above the value it rests at.

The stick direction bits (`StickLLeft` to `StickRDown`) are derived from the sticks at 50% deflection. With no gamepad connected the log says `input: no gamepad`.

Keys tilt a stick all the way, so on the keyboard alone Link always runs. `NX2NAVI_WALK_KEY` (`walk_key`, the *Walk key* row under *Analog sticks* on the Controls tab) names a key that, while held, scales the stick values the keys give (movement and camera keys) to `NX2NAVI_WALK_SCALE` of full (`walk_scale`, the *Walk scale* row; 0.2 to 0.9, default 0.51), so Link walks. The value is a key name of the `bind_` lines, or `none` (the default: off). The row offers Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Tab and Caps Lock and names the button a chosen key also presses: with the default bindings Shift is A, Ctrl is B and Tab is Plus, while Alt and Caps Lock are free. The gamepad's sticks and the mouse camera are not scaled. The default is just above half because half of a key's full value falls one short of the 50% the direction bits need. All three settings apply at once while the game runs.

`NX2NAVI_WALK_MODE` (`walk_mode`, the *Walk key mode* row) is `hold` (the default: walking while the key is held) or `toggle`: one press of the key walks, the next runs again. A press counts only while the game reads input: not while the menu or a text entry is open or waits for its release, not while the window is in the background, and a key still held when the game reads again (the press that closed the menu) counts only after it is released and pressed again. Walking stays on through the menu, a text entry, another window and the gamepad's use (the gamepad's sticks stay analogue); a new walk key or mode, or a restart, starts running again. The log says `input: walking on` or `off` at each switch.

## Nintendo Switch 2 controllers

Windows does not present the Switch 2 Pro Controller as a gamepad SDL can open (the log says `input: no gamepad`), so it needs a bridge program that wakes it and creates a virtual gamepad, for example one that emulates a DualSense: that gives buttons, rumble, gyro and accelerometer. The log then shows `input: gamepad "DualSense Wireless Controller" ... (rumble, gyro and accelerometer, ...)` and `input: motion sensors on`. Bridges that output a DualShock 4 whose gyro and accelerometer never change give buttons and rumble but no motion. Run one bridge at a time; Steam Input can also claim the controller, so close Steam if the bridge does not find it. With several virtual and real gamepads connected the game follows whichever one is pressed.

## PlayStation 3 controllers

With `ds3 = 1` in `nx2navi.ini` (off by default), a DualShock 3 on Windows is read directly (`runtime/input_ds3_win.c`) when no driver presents it to SDL or XInput as a gamepad. Plug it in by USB, or pair it with a Bluetooth driver that exposes it as a HID device with its own name, "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller"; the log then shows `input: DualShock 3 opened`, the controller's first player light turns on and `input: DualShock 3 is reporting` follows. The reader sends the controller the command that makes it start reporting, which it does not do on its own. It looks for a controller every three seconds while none is open, so one plugged in or switched on later is found without a restart.

| Switch | DualShock 3 by position |
|---|---|
| A, B, X, Y | circle, cross, triangle, square (east, south, north, west: the button layout setting applies as for any pad) |
| ZL, ZR | L2, R2 (over 50% pressure) |
| L, R | L1, R1 |
| Left, right stick click | L3, R3 |
| Plus, Minus | Start, Select |
| D-pad | D-pad |

The PS button is not used. The Controls tab binds and remaps its buttons like any other pad's, with the same pad names. Vibration works through the strength, curve and *Vibration* settings: the controller's light motor can only be on or off, so it comes on from a sixteenth of the amplitude the game asks of it. The accelerometer and the single gyro axis are not used: the game's motion controls need all three gyro axes, so a DualShock 3 gives no motion. `ds3 = 0` in `nx2navi.ini` (the default, live) turns the reader off. A controller that a driver presents in a generic gamepad mode, with another name or report layout, is not recognised by the reader and goes through SDL or XInput instead, as before.

## Scripted input

`NX2NAVI_INPUT_SCRIPT=<file>` replays presses. It is ORed with real input and still applies under `NX2NAVI_INPUT=none`. One event per line, `#` starts a comment:

```
<frame> <button> [hold_frames]            # A B X Y L R ZL ZR PLUS MINUS LEFT UP RIGHT DOWN LCLICK RCLICK; hold defaults to 4
<frame> LSTICK|RSTICK <x> <y> [hold_frames]   # -32767..32767, up is +y
```

`<frame>` counts 60 Hz ticks of game time since the first frame (presented frames at 60 fps). Each event logs once (`input: script frame N tick T: A`).

`NX2NAVI_INPUT_RECORD=<file>` (`input_record` in `nx2navi.ini`) writes the merged input in the same format, one line per button press and per stick segment. The file replays as a script, which makes it the repro to attach to a bug report.

`tools/run_game.py <game folder> --save <save> --seconds <s> --wall <w> [--script <file>] [--shot <png>]` runs the game on a copy of its profile with a save swapped in, under the script (default `tools/input/load_save.txt`: title screen to the first save slot). `<save>` names one of the game's save backups (`profile/save-backup/<time>`; the game keeps the last three) or is a save folder or `.zip` from elsewhere, such as the zipped profile folder of a crash report; a single slot (`slot_NN`) replaces only that slot. The run ends once `<s>` seconds of game time passed after the save loaded, `--shot` saving that frame as a PNG and `--env NX2NAVI_SHOTS=w<from>-<to>:<step>` one every `<step>` seconds of game time along the way (480x270, full size with `NX2NAVI_SHOTS_FULL=1`), or after `<w>` seconds of wall time. `--env NX2NAVI_SHOT_DIR=<dir> --env NX2NAVI_SHOT_AFTER=<s> --env NX2NAVI_SHOT_EVERY=<s>` takes pictures by wall time instead, for a script that never reaches a place where game time counts. On Windows it also takes `build\<ver>` folders and the saves in `build\save-backup`.

`NX2NAVI_TEST_PAD=<lx>,<ly>,<rx>,<ry>` attaches an SDL virtual gamepad at start whose sticks rest at these raw SDL axis values (-32768 to 32767, down is +y), so a drifting or held stick can be tested without a controller: the values go through the gamepad mapping and `NX2NAVI_STICK_DEADZONE` like a real pad's, and `NX2NAVI_INPUT_RECORD` shows what reached the game. `NX2NAVI_TEST_PAD_AT=<ms>` attaches it that long after input starts instead and presses its south button a second later, which tests a controller switched on in play.

`NX2NAVI_AUTOPILOT=<file>` (test runs, game 1.1.1; `runtime/autopilot.c`) drives Link through a route once the save has loaded, steering from his position and the camera's direction, which it reads from the game at every poll: a route reaches the same places at any frame rate and load length, where a frame-based script drifts. Its input is ORed with the real input and the input script, like the script's. One step per line, `#` starts a comment; times are seconds of game time, distances metres, `x` and `z` the world's ground coordinates (y up), as the placement files and the saves give them:

```
wait <s>
walk <x> <z> [radius <m>] [timeout <s>]   # half tilt; reached within radius (1), timeout (30), stuck: no 0.25 m nearer in 3 s
run <x> <z> [radius <m>] [timeout <s>]    # full tilt
look <x> <z> [timeout <s>]                # the right stick turns the camera until it faces the point within 10 degrees
camera <x> <y> <s>                        # the right stick held at x, y (-1..1, up +y)
stick <x> <y> <s>                         # the left stick held (open loop: into water, through a door)
press <button>[+<button>...] [<s>]        # held for s (0.1), then released for 0.1 s; the script's button names
hold <button>[+<button>...]               # held from here on, through the steps that follow (aim, then a picture)
release [<button>[+<button>...]]          # held buttons let go, all without a name
shot <name>                               # the next frame as <NX2NAVI_SHOT_DIR>/ap-<step>-<name>.png
log <text>
until <condition> [timeout <s>]           # waits until the game's state meets the condition: reached, or timeout (30)
expect <condition>                        # checks it once: met or unmet (counted at the end)
climb up|down [timeout <s>]               # the left stick up (down) while Link climbs: reached once his height stood still
                                          # 1 s after it changed, stuck when it never changed in 1.5 s, timeout (20)
trace <s>                                 # from here on a line every s seconds: Link's place, area, life, time of day
save [timeout <s>]                        # asks the game for its own autosave (its event node's request): done once it
                                          # saved, refused when the game's check refused until the timeout (60)
```

A condition is `flag <name><op><value>`, the game's own flag by its name (a Bool `0`/`1`; an Int or UInt a number with `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=` or `>=`; an Enum's value by its name; a String64's text), for example `flag HavePlayedEvent.Obj_Kokiri_MessageBoard_A_02=1` (a sign read) or `flag PlayerStatus.Life>=8` (life in quarter hearts), or `area <name>`, the area Link is in (`Sequence_CurrentBanc`: `KokiriForest_Child`, `LostWood_Child`, ...), which suits a step that crosses a load. The flags are read from the game's flag manager as the game keeps them; nothing is written. The game refuses an autosave for 1800 of its updates after each save, during the title and scene changes, and while `System_IsSaveTemporaryStorage` is set; the request is made only when its own check passes.

A script with an error is refused whole (`autopilot: <file> line N: ...`). The log shows `autopilot: gameplay at tick T` when the save has loaded, one line per finished step with its result (`done`, `reached`, `timeout`, `stuck`, `taken`, `missed`, `met`, `unmet`, `refused`) and Link's position, a progress line per second of a moving step, `autopilot: done: ...` with the counts, and `autopilot: route frames: ...`: the presented frames from the first step to the end of the last (mean fps, 1% low, frames over 25, 50 and 100 ms, game seconds and game speed), without the frames that carried a picture's capture.

## RenderDoc capture (blocked)

`NX2NAVI_RDOC=<frame>[,...]` (`runtime/rdoc_win.c`; `NX2NAVI_RDOC_DIR`, `NX2NAVI_RDOC_DLL`) loads RenderDoc before `vkCreateInstance`. RenderDoc hides `VK_EXT_external_memory_host`, which the back end requires for guest pool imports (`runtime/vk_memory.c`), so device creation fails under it. A capture needs a copy-based pool fallback first.
