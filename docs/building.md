# Building from source

Windows 10 or later, an x86-64 CPU with SSE4.2, and a GPU with Vulkan 1.3 and `VK_EXT_external_memory_host`. The
default build targets x86-64-v3 (AVX2/FMA); a CPU without them builds with `--cpu v2` instead and runs slower (see
"Build"). Allow about 60 GB for the work folder. Extraction wants about 55 GB free while it runs and keeps about 35 GB
afterwards.

Players who only want to play use the [launcher](launcher.md) instead: it installs its own build tools, builds the
game on their machine and keeps it up to date.

## Toolchain

Versions are the ones the build was verified with; newer patch releases are fine.

| Tool | Version | Install | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| MSYS2 UCRT64 | clang/lld 23.1.3 | msys2.org installer to `C:\msys64`, packages below | compiling the generated C and the runtime |
| Visual Studio Build Tools | 2026, C++ workload, Windows SDK 10.0.26100 | winget `Microsoft.VisualStudio.BuildTools` with `--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended` | the linker .NET NativeAOT calls |
| .NET SDK | 10.0 | winget `Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.10` | the shader translator (`nx2navi_xlate.exe`) |
| Vulkan SDK | 1.4.363 | winget `KhronosGroup.VulkanSDK` | validation layers, `vulkaninfo` |
| uv | 0.13 | standalone installer from astral.sh | the two Python environments |
| hactool | 1.4.0 @ `1d64a83` | `.venv\Scripts\python tools\build_hactool.py`, see below | NCA and update extraction |

MSYS2 packages, after `pacman -Syuu` (run it twice; the first pass updates the core and exits):

```sh
pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-{clang,lld,ninja,gcc,make,pkgconf,sdl3,opus,libvpx,zstd,vulkan-devel,\
vulkan-memory-allocator,vulkan-validation-layers,shaderc,spirv-tools} base-devel git unzip
```

`ffmpeg` from MSYS2 is a GPLv3 build and is never linked; the movies go through libvpx.

PATH:

- Add `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer` to the user PATH: NativeAOT needs `vswhere.exe`, or
  the publish fails at the link step (MSB3073).
- Another `cmake` or `ninja` earlier on PATH (a 32-bit winlibs MinGW, for example) is picked up by accident. The build
  scripts call Ninja from `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` themselves; from a shell, put `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` first.

### hactool

`tools/build_hactool.py` fetches hactool at `1d64a83` into `toolchain\src\hactool`, applies the three patches in
`tools/hactool/` and builds a static `toolchain\hactool\hactool.exe` with MSYS2 UCRT64 gcc (a few seconds):

- `portable.patch`: the changes a portable Windows build needs, the `MNG_TITLE_KEYS` variable and
  the two BKTR fixes in `nca.c` for the subsection table padding and the subsection layout of newer cumulative updates;
- `unicode.patch`: a manifest with `<activeCodePage>UTF-8</activeCodePage>`, so paths under a non-ASCII user profile
  reach it intact;
- `mbedtls-asm-clobbers.patch`: the `memory` and `cc` clobbers the bundled mbedtls 2.6.1's x86-64 multiply asm lacks.
  Without them a clang build (the Linux release) fails every RSA signature check and the update merge stops.

hactool reads `-k <prod.keys>`; MSYS2 shells set `HOME`, which hides its default key location, so pass `-k` there.

## Build

From the repository root, in PowerShell. Every step that depends on the game version takes it as `<ver>`: `v143` for
1.4.3, `v121` for 1.2.1 or `v110` for 1.1.0. The tools default to `v121` when `--version` is left out. Saves load on any
of them.

1. Python environments (once). `.venv` runs the lifter and the build; `.venv-py314` runs the extraction scripts, which
   need the stdlib `compression.zstd` of Python 3.14:

   ```powershell
   uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
   uv pip install --python .venv/Scripts/python.exe -r tools/requirements.txt
   uv venv --python 3.14 .venv-py314
   uv pip install --python .venv-py314/Scripts/python.exe -r tools/requirements-py314.txt
   ```

2. Copy `config.example.toml` to `config.local.toml` and set the paths to your base game, the update and your console's
   keys file. `config.local.toml` is ignored by git. The tools read the keys file themselves.

3. Extract and verify. This writes `build\extracted\v0` (1.0.0) and `build\extracted\<ver>` for each update in
   `updates`, identified by its hash; a hash mismatch stops the run. With another `[work] dir` in `config.local.toml`,
   `extracted` goes there instead, and `build_game.py` reads the ExeFS and RomFS from there:

   ```powershell
   .venv-py314\Scripts\python tools\extract.py
   ```

4. Shader translator (no game files; again after a change to its sources, and `tools\make_release.py` stops on an older
   one). This publishes `build\xlate\nx2navi_xlate.exe`:

   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\python tools\build_xlate.py
   ```

5. Lift the modules to C, write the RomFS overlay (the frame-rate fix), then compile and link
   `build\<ver>\nx2navi.exe`:

   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\python recomp\gen.py --exefs build\extracted\<ver>\exefs --out generated\<ver> --patches recomp\patches-<ver>.txt
   .venv-py314\Scripts\python tools\make_romfs_patches.py --version <ver>
   .venv\Scripts\python tools\build_game.py --version <ver>
   ```

   The runtime's own shaders (upscaling, HDR, texture decode and the like) are in the repository as source only:
   GLSL and SPIR-V assembly in `runtime\shaders\`, and two small ones assembled by `tools\make_dlaa_mask.py` and
   `tools\make_mvobj_fs.py`. `build_game.py` compiles them into `runtime\<name>_spv.h` (git ignores these) before it
   compiles the runtime, with `glslc`, `spirv-as` and `spirv-val` from the `shaderc` and `spirv-tools` packages above,
   and again whenever a source changed. `python tools\build_shaders.py` does that step alone; `--check` only reports
   the headers that are missing or stale.

   `--cpu v2` targets x86-64-v2 (SSE4.2, no AVX2/FMA) for older CPUs; the default `v3` needs AVX2. The v2 build links
   `runtime/fma.c`, a correctly rounded software fma the FP lowering needs, and runs slower. Inline assembly,
   target attributes and intrinsics are not bound by `-march`, so a v2 build runs `tools/check_isa.py` over the runtime
   objects before it links: any AVX, BMI or other instruction above x86-64-v2 outside a function listed there as
   dispatched by a runtime CPU check stops the build.

   `gen.py` sizes its emit pool from the CPU count and the free memory; `--jobs N` sets it, and so does the environment variable `NX2NAVI_LIFT_JOBS=N`, which the installer's lift step honours too (it has no `--jobs`). When a worker runs out of memory, the pool restarts with half the workers (`emit: out of memory with N workers, retrying with M`), down to one; only an out-of-memory error with one worker fails the step.

   Lifting takes about 15 s, a clean compile about 200 s on 24 threads; later builds recompile only what changed.
   A compiler cache in front of clang shortens it further: with `SCCACHE` set to an sccache executable, `build_game.py`
   writes it into the ninja file ahead of `cc`, and every lift rewrites the generated chunks with the same contents, so
   a second build of the same version hits all of their objects:

   ```powershell
   $env:SCCACHE = "path\to\sccache.exe"
   .venv\Scripts\python tools\build_game.py --version <ver>
   ```
   `--patches` builds in the frame-rate, resolution and other patch sets, switchable at run time. The link copies
   `SDL3.dll`, `libiconv-2.dll` and `libopus-0.dll` next to the exe.
   For Xbox button prompts, run `make_romfs_patches.py` twice more, with `--prompts xbox` and `--prompts xbox-label`:
   they write `build\<ver>\romfs-patches-xbox` and `romfs-patches-xbox-label` ([controls.md](controls.md), "Xbox
   button prompts"), which `build_game.py` copies next to `nx2navi.exe` like `romfs-patches`. `--prompts pc` writes
   `romfs-patches-pc`, the keyboard and mouse prompts ([controls.md](controls.md), "PC button prompts").

6. Prepare the shaders (once per build folder and translator). It needs `refs\MacNativeGames` (`tools\fetch_refs.sh`)
   for the shared shader list:

   ```powershell
   .venv-py314\Scripts\python tools\prepare_shaders.py build\<ver> --version <ver>
   ```

   Without this step the first launch compiles shaders and pipelines during play and stutters until the caches fill.
   The AMD driver keeps its pipeline cache per exe path and holds a limited amount: preparing another build folder can
   evict this one's. `nx2navi.exe --warm-shaders` rebuilds it from the shader cache. A driver update empties the
   driver's cache too, and a change to what a stage library is built with gives every library another entry in it.
   So an update that carries the prepared shaders over runs `--warm-shaders` (`tools/make_game.py`
   `warm_driver_cache`: seconds while the libraries are there, minutes when they are not), and the game itself checks
   at every start: it builds a sample of the prepared fragment libraries and, when their median time says the cache
   is cold, builds the whole prepared list into the driver's cache again on idle-priority threads while it runs
   (`runtime/vk_pipeline.c` `lw_start`, `NX2NAVI_LIB_WARM`; `shader-warm.txt` next to the caches says where that
   stands). With the cache cold every pipeline a draw first needs compiles in play: on an RX 7900 XT a library took
   93 ms (vertex) and 242 ms (fragment) on average against 0.3 and 0.6 ms from the cache, and a first walk through a
   village skipped 11,180 draws and made 94 draws wait 5.5 s in all, against 1,605 skipped (1,473 of them in the
   scene's first frames) and 60 ms of waits with the cache warm.
   A frame that still lacks draws when it is presented is not shown: the previous picture stays on screen
   (`runtime/vk_backend.c` `frame_hold`, `NX2NAVI_FRAME_HOLD_MS`, an allowance of 120 ms that fills again at an eighth
   of the clock's rate). On a first walk through a village with nothing recorded, 21 of the 23 such frames were held
   back; in a player's session a hit by a boulder had shown one black frame, its lighting pass skipped after 50 ms.
   When the driver's shader compiler crashes on a variant (NVIDIA 615.78.08 on an RTX 5080 does, issue #30),
   `prepare_shaders.py` runs the driver step again with `--warm-shaders`, up to three times, without the variants the
   driver was building at the crash. `shader-prepare-skip.txt` next to the exe lists them with the GPU and driver
   version; they build at their first draw instead, another driver version builds them again, and so does deleting the
   file.

7. Run. The game keeps running when its window loses the focus (`assume_focus = 1` in `nx2navi.ini`, the default; the
   Game tab switches it). With 0 it pauses, as it does on the Switch when Home is pressed.

   ```powershell
   build\<ver>\nx2navi.exe
   ```

Settings live in `nx2navi.ini` next to `nx2navi.exe` ([nx2navi.ini.example](../nx2navi.ini.example) lists them). Saves go to
`build\profile` for `v121` and `build\profile-<ver>` for other versions (`build_game.py --profile` changes it).

### Portable folder

`.venv\Scripts\python tools\package_build.py --version <ver>` writes `build\<ver>-portable`, which runs on another of
your machines without MSYS2, Python or .NET. `romfs.bin` stays out unless you pass `--with-romfs`; otherwise put it in
`romfs\` next to the exe or point `NX2NAVI_ROMFS` at its folder. Run `nx2navi.exe --prepare-shaders` once in the copied
folder. The folder holds code and data derived from your game: for your own machines only.

### Profile-guided build

`build_game.py --pgo <file>.profdata` compiles the generated code at -O2 with an execution profile, and the runtime
with it too: hot paths laid out straight, hot calls inlined, code that never ran compiled for size. On 1.4.3 the fight
bench ran 12-15% faster per frame and a fight outside the training about 6%. The installer builds with
`data/pgo-<ver>.profdata` of the release when the update has one, else at -O1.

A profile only fits the generated C it was trained on: functions are matched by name and control-flow hash, so a
function whose C changes loses its counts without a warning. Retrain after a lifter or generator change, from a clean
`recomp/`. The instrumented build needs llvm-mingw, as MSYS2's clang has no profile runtime:

```powershell
$llvm = "toolchain\llvm-mingw-<date>\llvm-mingw-<date>-ucrt-x86_64"
.venv\Scripts\python tools\build_game.py --version v143 --out build\v143-pgogen --toolchain $llvm --pgo gen
```

Play `build\v143-pgogen\nx2navi.exe` through varied scenes (fights, towns, riding, building, underground, menus) for 20-30
minutes; it is slower than a normal build. It writes `build\v143-pgogen\pgo\*.profraw` every minute and at exit.
Scripted runs from saves (`tools/run_game.py`) add to the same file. Then:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python tools\pgo.py merge build\v143-pgogen --version v143
```

writes `build\pgo\pgo-v143.profdata` and its record (`.json`: the `recomp/` tree it fits). `make_release.py` ships every
profile of `build\pgo` in `data\` and warns when a record names another `recomp/` tree than the one released.

## Linux (in progress)

The runtime builds and runs on x86-64 Linux with a window, input and menu on SDL3 (`*_sdl.c`) in place of the Win32
files (`*_win.c`); `runtime/platform/linux.c` implements `platform.h`. Status: the selftest and the probes pass; 1.2.1
plays at 60 fps on RADV (RX 7800 XT) and NVIDIA (RTX 3060); 1.4.3 builds, probes and plays on RADV (RX 6600, and the
Vega 7 of a Ryzen 5 4600G at about 34 fps). Long play sessions and the Steam Deck itself are not verified yet.

Requirements:

- Linux 6.7 or later: the write watch uses userfaultfd write protection with `PAGEMAP_SCAN`. SteamOS 3.8 qualifies.
- A Vulkan 1.3 driver with `VK_EXT_external_memory_host` (RADV, NVIDIA).
- Packages on Arch:

  ```sh
  pacman -S --needed clang lld ninja make sdl3 opus libvpx zstd vulkan-headers vulkan-icd-loader \
      vulkan-validation-layers shaderc spirv-tools dotnet-sdk uv git
  ```

  Vulkan Memory Allocator is a single header (AUR `vulkan-memory-allocator`). Without it, `build_game.py` fetches the
  version the Windows release pins (3.4.0) into `toolchain/vma/` on first use and checks its hash.

The steps are the Windows ones with POSIX paths: `.venv/bin/python` in place of `.venv\Scripts\python`, and `nx2navi` in
place of `nx2navi.exe`. `build_game.py` takes clang, lld and Ninja from PATH (or the ones in `<dir>/bin` with
`--toolchain <dir>`) and links against the system libraries, with `libstdc++` static and an `$ORIGIN` rpath;
`build_hactool.py` builds `hactool` with make. `tools/prepare_shaders.py` reads the shader list from
`refs/MacNativeGames` at `origin/HEAD`, which must be the pinned commit with its history (the list format changed later).

The probes open a window, so from an SSH session they need the desktop session's display, or they stop at `gpu 0
skipped: no graphics+compute+present queue family`: on Wayland `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland` (the socket name is in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`), on X11 `DISPLAY=:0`.

NVIDIA's Linux driver compiles into a disk cache of its own. A process adds at most `__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SIZE` to it
(1 GiB by default; at a start the files after the first are deleted while the folder is over that size), and the default
folder, `~/.cache/nvidia`, is shared with every program. `--prepare-shaders` of game 1.1.1 builds 42,142 variants, about
1.5 GB: on the default limit about 30,700 of them were stored and the rest compiled again at their first draw in play.
`runtime/vk_device.c` therefore points `__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH` at `nvidia-cache` beside `ocarina` and the size at
8 GiB, each unless the environment sets it, as it does `MESA_SHADER_CACHE_DIR` for RADV, and only while NVIDIA's kernel
driver is loaded (`/proc/driver/nvidia/version`). The driver does not make that folder and caches nothing in a folder it
cannot write, so the game makes it, and when it cannot make or write it sets neither variable. A game run sets them in
`main` before any of its threads starts, since a thread can load the Vulkan driver before the instance is made. The
folder can be deleted; `ocarina --warm-shaders` fills it again.

Memory: on Windows the GPU imports guest memory and `GetWriteWatch` tracks the CPU's writes to it. On Linux,
re-protecting imported memory invalidates the driver's userptr buffer on every submit (about 1.3 ms per 16 MiB on
amdgpu), and importing pins the pages, which drops their write protection. Each CPU-visible pool therefore gets a
host-visible copy (shadow storage, `runtime/vk_memory.c`): the pages the CPU wrote go in before each submit, and the GPU's
writes come back at its fence. Pages both sides write keep a base copy, so each direction moves only its own bytes;
a VRAM mirror's write-back merge marks the pages it changed, and only those are compared at the fence; a lookup that
reads guest memory itself (the uniform snapshot, `vk_mem_lookup`) does not queue its pool for the copy-in. In Kokiri
Forest (1.1.1, RTX 4090) that costs about 1 ms a frame (copy-in 0.5 ms, write-back 0.6 ms), and the copies hold about
5 GB. `NX2NAVI_SHADOW=1` turns it on under Windows too. The Steam Deck's RADV has `VK_EXT_external_memory_host` as
well: the shadow copies are chosen for the measured cost above, not for a missing extension. NVIDIA's own driver on Linux
imports instead (`NX2NAVI_SHADOW=1` brings the copies back): it imports guest memory without that cost, and there the
copies are the slower path and draw a wrong picture. In Kokiri Forest on 0.7.1 (RTX 4090, driver 615.78), imports with
VRAM mirrors ran at 51.9 frames a second with no frame flagged by the flicker scanner in 6,627; the copies ran at 27.4,
and 2,668 of 4,227 frames were flagged (brighter, with a white haze, alternating frame by frame).

The device address table (`runtime/vk_gpa.c`) names a pool's shadow copy as it names an import, so shaders follow guest
pointers into either. A shader that reads through the table resolves nothing, so the pool it reaches is not queued for
the copy-in: a part whose pipelines declare the table is marked at its draws and dispatches, and its prologue brings
the shadow of every pool in the table up to date with the pages the CPU wrote and queues the same pages for those
pools' VRAM mirrors (`vk_memory.c` `vk_mem_gpa_sync`). That copies the written pages of every CPU-visible pool in
each such part, which the cost above does not include. What a shader stores through the table into a shadow copy does
not come back to guest memory. `--probe-vkmem` checks the read: a shader follows the table to a word of a pool that is
never bound, and must read `0x13579BDF` and, after a plain CPU write, `0x2468ACE0`. On Linux, run it for each backing:

```sh
for shadow in 0 1; do for memory in import mirror; do
    NX2NAVI_GPA=1 NX2NAVI_SHADOW=$shadow NX2NAVI_MEMORY=$memory ./ocarina --probe-vkmem
done; done
```

The Deck's GPU (Van Gogh) has no native ASTC, so its textures go through the compute decoder (`runtime/vk_astc.c`,
`NX2NAVI_ASTC`) as on desktop AMD GPUs without it; frame times measured there include it.

## Checks

Before a commit:

- `python tools/check_content.py --staged`: nothing game-derived and no compiled shader is staged. CI runs the same check;
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` runs it before each local commit.
- `build\<ver>\nx2navi.exe --selftest`: layout, dispatch table and host-function registry, without game files.

A change to the in-game menu's look (`runtime/ui/menu_skin.cpp`, `option_rows.cpp`, `perf_panel.cpp`) can be looked at
without game files: `python tools/menu_preview.py` builds the menu's own drawing code with the host's clang++ and
writes the Screen tab, the full performance overlay and the boot screen to `build/menu-preview/` (`menu.png`,
`overlay.png`, `boot.png`; a stand-in font, and the window's plain border in place of the game's ornamented frame).
With `--romfs <extracted RomFS folder>` it draws the game's interface textures as the game does, and
`tools/ui_textures.py <folder>` lists the textures there and dumps those matching `--match` to `build/ui-textures/`;
both decode the game's files, so they run with `.venv-py314\Scripts\python` (`compression.zstd` and numpy). What they
write is decoded game data: keep it under `build/`.

A change to the shared save (`runtime/save_zip.c`, `runtime/save_share.c`, the save import in `runtime/fs_host.c`)
passes `python tests\save_zip_check.py` and `python tests\save_share_check.py`. The first builds `save_zip.c` alone
and checks its deflate, inflate, zip writer and reader against Python's zlib and zipfile both ways, and that the
launcher imports a zip it wrote. The second builds `fs_host.c` and `save_share.c` with the rest of the runtime stubbed
and runs each step as a start of the game on a profile it makes: the export, an import from a zip the launcher
exported, its backup and swap at the next start, the zips it refuses and Cancel. No game files.

A change to the step Ocarina is given each frame (`runtime/frame_rate.c` `ocarina_step`) passes
`python tests\frame_step_check.py`, which builds `frame_rate.c` with the rest of the runtime stubbed and feeds it
display times: a held 60 fps limit gives exactly one frame every frame, a 240 fps limit never less than a quarter
frame, uneven frame times one steady step, and game time follows the clock. No game files.

A change to which waits a signalled event or an ended thread wakes (`runtime/kernel.c` `wake_sync_waiters`, the
`WaitSynchronization` service) passes `python tests\sync_wake_check.py`, which builds `kernel.c` with the platform
layer and the rest of the runtime stubbed and runs guest threads whose entries are host functions: a signal wakes the
waits on its event and leaves the others asleep, a wait on several handles reports the right one, a thread's end ends
the wait on it, timed waits keep their time, a cancel ends any wait, and 4,000 signals to eight looping waiters are
each seen. It runs a second time with `NX2NAVI_SYNC_WAKE_ALL=1`. No game files.

A change to the log queue (`runtime/logq.c`) passes `python tests\logq_check.py`, which builds it with the platform
layer and a destination of its own: 160,000 lines from eight threads arrive whole and in each thread's order, a line
logged while the queue's lock is taken waits and does not pass the lines queued before it, a destination that takes
30 ms a write does not hold the threads that log, the line about slow writes comes once in ten seconds, a destination
that stops while four times the queue's size is logged loses nothing, and `logq_sync` returns with everything written.
The test passes on a busy machine too: it waits for the queue to empty instead of for a time, and counts slow lines
instead of timing one. No game files.

A change to the button prompts (`tools/make_romfs_patches.py --prompts`, `tools/button_icons.py`) passes
`.venv-py314\Scripts\python tests\romfs_prompts_test.py`, which runs the tool on a RomFS it makes itself (no game
files); a change to the settings passes `nx2navi.exe --probe-cfg`.

A change to what the library warm logs when the driver's cache of stage libraries is cold (`runtime/vk_warm_hint.h`,
`runtime/vk_pipeline.c` `lw_main`) passes `python tests\warm_hint_check.py`, which builds the header alone and checks
the added text by GPU vendor and by why the cache was cold. No game files.

The lifter (`recomp/`) and the CPU headers (`runtime/cpu.h`, `runtime/simd.h`) are checked against Unicorn. Every lifter
change passes these, all run with `.venv`:

| Test | Checks | Game files |
|---|---|---|
| `tests\diff\lift.py` | instructions sampled from the extracted modules; `--coverage` lists every word the lifter rejects or traps | yes |
| `tests\diff\simd.py` | the whole FP/SIMD encoding space | no |
| `tests\diff\atomic.py` | exclusive load/store sequences and ARMv8.1 atomics | no |
| `tests\diff\func.py` | whole functions as the generator emits them, loops, jump tables and calls included (calls go to a stub that checks the registers at the call) | yes |
| `tests\flags_check.py` | the function-local flag helpers of `runtime\cpu.h` against its packed ones | no |
| `tests\ds3_check.py` | the DualShock 3 report decoding and output report of `runtime\input_ds3.c` | no |
| `tests\gpa_check.py` | the device address table of `runtime\vk_gpa.c` as a shader reads it: mapping, mirrors and twins, overlapping imports, and blocks given back and taken again while pool addresses climb (no GPU; any Python) | no |
| `tests\autopilot_check.py` | the test autopilot's script parser, its steering for every camera direction and whole routes against a simulated Link (`runtime\autopilot.c`) | no |
| `tests\excl_mt.py` | the exclusive monitor helpers under contention and ABA, on several threads | no |
| `tests\jumptables_check.py` | `recomp/jumptables.py` against a Unicorn oracle; must report 0 disagreements, on 1.4.3 too | yes |

A `--cpu v2` build passes the same differential tests with `--cflags=-march=x86-64-v2`; they compile `runtime/fma.c`
too, so they check the software fma the v2 build links rather than the C runtime's.

On NVIDIA Linux, `NX2NAVI_DLAA=1 ./ocarina --probe-vkdevice` logs NGX initialization and shutdown when available.

Runtime probes, each a mode of `nx2navi.exe` (the list is at the top of `runtime/main.c`): `--probe-kernel`,
`--probe-vkexec`, `--probe-nvn-tex` and `--probe-shader` cover most runtime changes. `--probe-shader` and the draw
part of `--probe-vkexec` translate shaders of the census below: they look for `build/<ver>/shaders/jobs.json` of the
exe's own version first, then of the other one.
`--probe-vkmem` also checks CPU-backed texture uploads and rewrites, GPU-written texture aliases, and memory write watches.
A change to the texture detail (`runtime/vk_texture.c` "texture detail": `detail_skip`, `upload`, `astc_bl_regions`)
passes it three times, with `NX2NAVI_TEXTURE_DETAIL` set to `full`, `reduced` and `low`: each time ASTC textures are
uploaded and rewritten, and every level and layer of their images must hold the game's level it stands for.
`--probe-prewarm` runs the boot's pipeline stages without the game, from the caches next to the exe (it skips when
there are none): the pipeline cache load, the shader prewarm, the recorded pipelines and the compute pipeline prebuild,
with a `mem: boot stage` log line after each that gives the device memory and the process commit so far. It then asks
for compute pipelines the boot did not keep, as their first dispatch would, and prints what one costs. The device
memory after the compute stage should be what it was before the stage, apart from the kept pipelines. A change to what
the boot builds or keeps (`runtime/vk_pipeline.c`: `prewarm_run`, `lb_compute`, the `compute-used.bin` record) passes it.

Shaders: `.venv-py314\Scripts\python tools\shader_census.py --version <ver> --translate` extracts every Maxwell shader
to `build\<ver>\shaders\` and runs it through the translator and `spirv-val`; failure groups go to `failures.txt`.
`tools\xlate_smoke.py` checks the translator alone, without game files.

A change to the SM86 tensor lowering (`tools/xlate/AmpereLowering.cs` Hmma, Ldsm, Movm, Half) passes
`python tests\tensor_lowering_check.py`: it lowers GPU-captured vectors with `nx2navi_xlate --lower` and runs them on
`tests\maxwell_warp_emu.py`, a model of what the shader translator makes of Maxwell code (the docstring names the
vector file and what is checked). `tests\maxwell_warp_emu_selftest.py` checks the emulator itself. No game files.

## Reverse engineering (optional)

- Ghidra 12.1.2 with the Ghidra-Switch-Loader extension in `toolchain\ghidra\` (JDK 21) opens the game modules (NSO).
