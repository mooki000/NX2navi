// Lazy write-back (NX2NAVI_WB_LAZY, default 1 on Windows and 0 elsewhere, vk_memory.c "lazy write-back"). It was off
// by default in 0.7.0: with it on, single frames came out with the whole scene's shadowing missing, 10 to 180 of 1,800
// presents standing in Hyrule Field with other programs keeping the CPU busy and none found with it off. That was
// not this code's doing: frames were drawn from copies taken before the game's signal that their data was written
// (vk_exec_xfer.c "events the CPU signals"), and with the write-backs gone the frames came faster and the signal fell
// into the replay more often. With that fixed, two such runs under eight busy threads showed none.
// What a shader wrote into a mirrored pool is
// copied back into guest memory at the end of every submission, in case the CPU reads it. Ocarina's CPU does not read
// most of it: standing in Hyrule Field, 66 MiB a frame went back over PCIe, 7 to 9 ms of each frame's 13 to 15 ms of
// GPU time, and the write-back probe found no access to it in 40 s. So a range that went back once is armed here: its
// whole pages are made inaccessible (mem_lazy_arm), and while it stays armed the back end leaves its later writes in
// the mirror (mem_lazy_skip marks it stale). The first read or write of an armed page faults: lazy_fault has the
// back end copy the range's bytes down now (lz_fetch, a GPU copy after everything submitted so far), gives the pages
// back and runs the access again, and the range stays out for a while (lz_hot: 1 s, doubling to 32 s while it keeps
// being touched), written back every submission as before. Every thaw (before the kernel writes or reads guest
// memory, and before mapping changes) releases the armed ranges of its regions the same way.
// A region with armed pages is not frozen (freeze_locked wants every page read-write), and a frozen one is not armed.
// A fetch brings what the GPU work handed over so far wrote. The part of a submission that is being recorded has left
// its writes out as well, and makes up for it when it finds a range it skipped no longer armed (vk_memory.c
// lazy_part_check). Between that check and the part's hand-over a release would be seen by neither side, so the
// replay opens a window there (mem_lazy_window) and a fault on an armed page waits for it to close: the fetch then
// has the part's writes. Only a fault of the replay thread itself, a wait of 20 ms, or a release by a thaw goes ahead
// inside the window (lz_gaps counts the faults): that part's writes to the range then reach guest memory with the
// range's next write-back.
