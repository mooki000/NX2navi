// Transfers of the Vulkan op-stream replay: buffer and texture copies, texture
// clears, event signals, counter reports and conditional rendering. vk_exec.c calls vk_exec_op_xfer for these ops.
//
// Buffers are guest memory: vk_mem_resolve maps an address to the VkBuffer behind its pool, textures are the vk_texture.c images
// (linear texel layout, GENERAL layout; block-linear storage is only converted when a mirrored texture is uploaded). So a
// copy is one Vulkan transfer command and the pitch of a buffer side comes from the payload (OP_COPY_STRIDE or the
// tight row). Every copy ends the open pass and starts with a full barrier. Destinations: an image is marked
// GPU-written at record time; a CPU-visible buffer range is reported to vk_gpu_written once the GPU is done (write
// watch does not see GPU writes, textures stored there re-upload).
//
// Events and counters are CPU-visible side effects. Their values go into guest memory on the completion thread through
// vk_completion_add, in submit order, as gfx_null.c does: event WRITE / ADD, counter {0, timestamp} for every type but
// samples passed. A timestamp report puts 0 in the counter word: NX2NAVI gates its clears on two such words being unequal.
//
// Samples passed (NVN_COUNTER_TYPE_SAMPLES_PASSED) is a running count on the queue: RESET_COUNTER zeroes it, every
// draw after it adds the samples that passed the depth and stencil tests, REPORT_COUNTER writes the running value.
// NX2NAVI resets and reports it 3 to 8 times a frame in the field and its CPU reads the results back (f_70010c3298); a 0
// there culls what the query tested. The replay counts with Vulkan occlusion queries ("occlusion counts" below).
//
// Conditional rendering is a CPU-side skip, not VK_EXT_conditional_rendering: the extension compares one 32-bit word
// with zero, NVN compares the counter words at addr and addr + 16. The condition is evaluated when the op is recorded
// from guest memory; a counter reported by an earlier submission that is not done yet counts as 0 if it is a timestamp,
// as unknown if it is samples passed. An unknown count renders: the report usually sits in the command buffer being
// recorded, so its value cannot be waited for, and the word in memory still holds an older query's count. Rendering
// costs at most the work the condition would have saved; in the field
// NX2NAVI conditions only on timestamp reports. The condition sets VkExec.render_disabled, which vk_exec.c honours for
// clears and vk_exec_draw.c for draws and dispatches. A condition that cannot be read (address outside every pool)
// renders.
// Copies and CLEAR_TEX are not conditional.

// draw begins another. A Vulkan query begun inside a render pass must end inside it. NX2NAVI always resets, draws the
// tested proxies, reports, so counting stops at a report and restarts at the next reset: queries cover only the draws
// between the two, not every pass of the frame. Once the game reports twice without a reset in between, counting stays
// on for good (cumulative NVN semantics; that one report misses the draws since the previous one). The queries closed since the last
// report or reset form a segment, handed to the completion thread with that report or reset: in submit order it sums
// the segment's results into the running count (a reset drops the sum and zeroes the count) and writes the count of a
// report into guest memory. Slots come from one ring; the completion thread reads and host-resets them
// (hostQueryReset, Vulkan 1.2), so the replay records no reset commands. A full ring (no slot read back yet) leaves the
// draw uncounted and the segment's count at least 1, as does a query still unavailable after its fence. Without hostQueryReset the counts stay 0.

// wait whose signal comes in a later submission does not hold its work back: that work runs before what it waits for.
// The replay keeps the value each event reaches in replay order (ev_seen, the signals recorded so far, on top of the
// value in memory) and counts the waits it reaches unmet; NX2NAVI_TRACE=perf logs the count, and the first few are
// logged as they happen. Replay thread only.

// ---- events the CPU signals
// Ocarina gates its main queue on the CPU: each frame the game sets one of two events to 0 (they take turns frame by
// frame), submits the worker queues' command buffers and the main queue's, whose first command waits for the event
// to be 1, and signals 1 from the CPU (nvnEventSignal) once it has finished writing what the frame's commands read.
// The signal comes before the main queue's submit call, after it, or while that call is replaying. On the console
// the GPU starts the queue at the signal and reads memory from then on.
// Here a submission's recording begins with the copies of what it reads: the VRAM mirrors' sync and the uniform
// snapshot (vk_exec_record), and the wait is tested when the walk reaches it, some hundred microseconds later. A
// signal that came in between passed the wait, and the frame was drawn from copies taken before the game had
// finished writing: single frames with the scene's shadowing missing or the whole scene black, the interface as it
// was, most of them when other work keeps the CPU busy, since the game's threads then finish later and the signal
// falls into the replay more often.
// So a wait is tested against the value the event had when the submission took its copies: every nvnEventSignal is
// numbered and keeps the value it replaced (vk_exec_event_cpu, before the write), vk_exec_record notes the number at
// its start (vk_exec_event_sync), and a signal with a later number does not count for that submission. The wait then
// stops the submission like any wait reached before its signal, and vk_backend.c submit_sync lets it go on at once
// in a submission of its own, whose copies are taken after the signal.
// NX2NAVI_EVENT_AT_SYNC=0: the value in memory when the walk reaches the wait, as before.
